# nc-fe-messenger-app
NC Messenger Over the next two days you will be making a full stack web app. It will be a chat-room style messenger app but the implementation is largely up to you!  The goal is to practice your teamwork and communication skills, whilst learning a new technology. All of which will be developed using agile practices.  To get you started we have provided some user stories and done a little bit of research into tech choices for you. These include a few non-traditional developer ones that are just for learning purposes.  User Stories As a user, I can use a web-app to view the chat. As a user, I can post a message to the chat. As a user, I receive messages from other users in real-time. As a user, I receive messages with a username and avatar image, telling me who posted it. As a user, I can change my username. As a user, I can change my avatar image using a url. As a user, I can see which other users are online. As a user, I received a message when another user connects / disconnects.
